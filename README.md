# Ethertone

Ethertone™ is Pantone™ for the blockchain™

You just send ETH to the contract, and a color name (limited to 32 bytes), and a color.

Wow! So useful! (Also I get all the proceeds. Writing these 50 lines of ~~law~~ code was so hard after all.)

Basically this recreates the entire business model of [The "Official" Register of Color Names](https://color-register.org).
